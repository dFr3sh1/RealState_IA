### General Info

In the framework of my studies SAS DEV IA (Artificial Intelligence) at Simplon, Lille.

This project aims develop my skills in AI, Data Analysis, algorithms, and Django framework.

This project was the final evaluataion of my course.

The project predicts houses prices upon categorial variables to fill in the form.

To achieve to this prediction I have tested several algorithms models from Scikit-Learn. The machine learning was trained trough supervised learning model with Linear regression and KnnRegression algorithms.

The algorithm will analyse all categorial variables between the 15 neighbours with similar or close values to ouput a price.
